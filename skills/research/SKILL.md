## Occasions

| Occasion | Output Focus |
|----------|--------------|
| `discovery` | Questions to ask, pain points to probe, qualification criteria |
| `demo` | Use cases to show, proof points to cite, objections to prepare for |
| `follow-up` | Next steps, open questions, momentum builders |

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:research`:

### Step 1: Parse Input and Detect Occasion

**Identify the target:**
- Email address → Person research
- Domain → Company research
- LinkedIn URL → Person research
- Name + company → Person research
- Meeting/deal description → Context-based (extract company/people)

**Detect or ask occasion:**

If `--for` not specified, infer from context or ask:

```
What are you preparing for?

1. Discovery call - First conversation, qualifying the opportunity
2. Demo - Showing the product, proving value
3. Follow-up - Continuing a conversation, next steps
4. Outreach - Cold/warm outreach, getting a response
5. Pipeline review - Assessing deal health, planning next moves
6. General research - Just want to know more

Your choice:
```

### Step 2: Research the Target

**For Person:**
```
# Try to enrich the person
enrich_person({
  person: {
    email: "<email>",           # if provided
    linkedInProfile: "<url>",   # if provided
    firstName: "<first>",       # if provided
    lastName: "<last>",         # if provided
    companyDomain: "<domain>"   # if provided
  }
})

# Also get company context
enrich_company({ companyDomain: "<domain>" })

# Match to personas
qualify_person({
  person: { ... },
  additionalContext: "Match to our buyer personas and playbooks"
})
```

**For Company:**
```
# Enrich the company
enrich_company({ companyDomain: "<domain>" })

# Qualify against ICP
qualify_company({
  companyDomain: "<domain>",
  additionalContext: "Evaluate fit against our segments and playbooks"
})

# Find key contacts
find_person({
  searchMode: "people",
  companyDomain: "<domain>",
  fuzzyTitles: ["<titles from matching persona>"],
  limit: 5
})
```

**Gather Library Context:**

Use MCP tools:
```
# Find matching playbook
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<company industry> <persona title> <identified pain points>",
  entityTypes: ["playbook"]
})

# Get relevant proof points
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<company industry> <company size> results",
  entityTypes: ["proof_point", "reference"]
})

# Get competitor context if detected
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<any competitor signals>",
  entityTypes: ["competitor"]
})
```
