# /octave:abm - Account Planner

Create comprehensive account plans for target accounts by combining deep research, stakeholder mapping, persona matching, and coordinated outreach — all grounded in your library's playbooks and proof points.

## Usage

```
/octave:abm <company> [--stakeholders <N>] [--playbook <name>] [--depth quick|full]
```

## Examples

```
/octave:abm acme.com                                      # Full account plan
/octave:abm acme.com --stakeholders 5                     # Map top 5 stakeholders
/octave:abm acme.com --playbook "Enterprise"              # Use specific playbook
/octave:abm acme.com --depth quick                        # Quick assessment only
/octave:abm "Acme Corp"                                   # Search by company name
```

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:abm`:

### Step 1: Identify Target Account

Parse input:
- Domain (e.g., `acme.com`) → Use directly
- Company name → Search for domain
- LinkedIn URL → Extract domain

If company name provided without domain:
```
find_company({ name: "<company_name>" })
```

### Step 2: Deep Account Research

```
# Full company enrichment
enrich_company({ companyDomain: "<domain>" })

# Qualify against ICP
qualify_company({
  companyDomain: "<domain>",
  additionalContext: "Evaluate fit against all segments. Identify which segment, use cases, and playbooks are most relevant."
})
```

### Step 3: Stakeholder Mapping

```
# Find decision makers and influencers
# Use persona titles from library to guide search
list_all_entities({ entityType: "persona" })

# Search for stakeholders matching each persona
find_person({
  searchMode: "people",
  companyDomain: "<domain>",
  fuzzyTitles: ["<titles from persona 1>"],
  limit: <stakeholders_param or 3>
})

# Repeat for other relevant personas if needed
find_person({
  searchMode: "people",
  companyDomain: "<domain>",
  fuzzyTitles: ["<titles from persona 2>"],
  limit: 3
})
```

For each key stakeholder found:
```
# Enrich top stakeholders
enrich_person({
  person: {
    firstName: "<first>",
    lastName: "<last>",
    companyDomain: "<domain>"
  }
})

# Qualify against personas
qualify_person({
  person: {
    firstName: "<first>",
    lastName: "<last>",
    companyDomain: "<domain>",
    jobTitle: "<title>"
  },
  additionalContext: "Match to our buyer personas. Identify their likely role in a buying decision (champion, evaluator, economic buyer, blocker)."
})
```

### Step 4: Match Playbooks and Gather Intelligence

```
# Find best-fit playbook
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<company industry> <company size> <identified personas>",
  entityTypes: ["playbook"]
})

# Get playbook with value props
get_playbook({ oId: "<playbook_oId>", includeValueProps: true })

# Find relevant proof points (industry, size match)
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<company industry> <company size> results case study",
  entityTypes: ["proof_point", "reference"]
})

# Check for competitive context
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<company name> <any tech stack signals>",
  entityTypes: ["competitor"]
})

# Check for any existing conversation history
list_events({
  startDate: "<365 days ago>",
  filters: {
    companyDomains: ["<domain>"]
  }
})
```
