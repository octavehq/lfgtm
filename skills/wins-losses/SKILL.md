### Step 2: Query Deal Data

**For Overview:**
```
# Get won deals
list_events({

  dateRange: { start: "<period start>", end: "<today>" },
  limit: 50
})

# Get lost deals
list_events({

  limit: 50
})

# Get findings from won deals
list_findings({
  opportunityStatus: ["WON"],
  extractionTypes: [
    "CALL_EXTERNAL_OBJECTIONS",
    "CALL_INTERNAL_VALUE_PROP_PRESENTATIONS",
    "CALL_INTERNAL_PROOF_POINTS",
    "CALL_EXTERNAL_COMPETITORS_TO_OUR_OFFERING"
  ],
  dateRange: { start: "<period start>", end: "<today>" },
  limit: 100
})

# Get findings from lost deals
list_findings({
  opportunityStatus: ["LOST"],
  extractionTypes: [
    "CALL_EXTERNAL_OBJECTIONS",
    "CALL_INTERNAL_VALUE_PROP_PRESENTATIONS",
    "CALL_EXTERNAL_COMPETITORS_TO_OUR_OFFERING"

### Step 3: Analyze Patterns

Aggregate findings across won/lost deals:

```
list_findings({
  eventTypes: ["DEAL_WON", "DEAL_LOST"],
  dateRange: { start: "<period start>", end: "<today>" }
})
```

COMPETITOR LOSSES (10 deals, $1.3M)
-----------------------------------

COMPETITOR A (5 deals, $600K)
Primary loss reasons:
• Price (3 deals): "40% cheaper"
• Feature parity (2 deals): "Does everything you do"

Where they beat us:
• Lower price point
• Aggressive discounting
• Faster initial response

Where we SHOULD have won:
• Better integration story
• Stronger customer success
• More robust platform

Winnable if: We had addressed price earlier with TCO story

---

COMPETITOR B (3 deals, $480K)
Primary loss reasons:
• Existing relationship (2 deals): "Already using their CRM"
• Brand recognition (1 deal): "Safer choice"

Where they beat us:
• Bundle pricing with existing tools
• Executive relationships
• Brand trust with board

Winnable if: We had engaged earlier, before competitor expanded

---

NO DECISION LOSSES (8 deals, $1.1M)
-----------------------------------

Why deals died:
• Budget reallocation: 3 deals
• Priority shift: 3 deals
• Leadership change: 2 deals

Warning signs we missed:
• Long gaps between meetings (avg 18 days vs 7 in wins)
• Single-threaded (1.5 contacts vs 3.4 in wins)
• No executive sponsor identified

These were likely not real opportunities.
→ Recommendation: Improve qualification at discovery

---

UNRESOLVED OBJECTION LOSSES (5 deals, $720K)
--------------------------------------------

| Objection | Deals | Value | Could We Have Saved? |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Need on-prem | 2 | $340K | No - product gap |
| Missing integration | 2 | $180K | Maybe - roadmap item |
| ROI not clear | 1 | $200K | Yes - poor execution |

Product Feedback:
• On-prem: Lost $340K this quarter alone
• [Integration] gap: Lost $180K, requested 4x in calls

---

LOSS TIMELINE ANALYSIS
----------------------

Average days in each stage before loss:

Discovery → Demo: 12 days (vs 8 in wins)
Demo → Proposal: 18 days (vs 10 in wins)
Proposal → Decision: 32 days (vs 27 in wins)

Deals that drag past 45 days have 20% win rate
→ Create re-qualification checkpoint at day 45

---

PERSONAS IN LOST DEALS
----------------------

| Persona | Deals Lost | Win Rate Overall |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| CTO | 8 | 28% |
| VP Ops | 6 | 42% |
| CFO | 5 | 25% |
| Director | 4 | 38% |

CTO and CFO deals have lowest win rates
→ Review messaging for these personas

---

Want me to:
1. Show specific lost deal details
2. Create competitive counter-messaging
3. Build re-qualification checklist
4. Compare to previous quarter

#### Deal Deep Dive (--company)

```
DEAL DEEP DIVE: Acme Corp
=========================

Status: LOST
Amount: $180,000
Close Date: January 15, 2026
Lost To: Competitor A
Sales Cycle: 78 days

---

DEAL TIMELINE
-------------

Nov 1 - Inbound lead from CTO
Nov 8 - Discovery call (CTO + VP Eng)
Nov 15 - Technical demo (4 attendees)
Nov 22 - Security review call
Dec 5 - Proposal sent
Dec 12 - Pricing discussion (CFO joined)
Dec 20 - "Comparing with Competitor A"
Jan 5 - "Going with Competitor A"
Jan 15 - Deal marked lost

Red flags in hindsight:
⚠ Dec 12: CFO joined late - pricing concern
⚠ Dec 20: Competitor mentioned - should have addressed immediately
⚠ 14 days gap Dec 20 → Jan 5 - lost momentum

---

KEY CONVERSATIONS
-----------------

Discovery Call (Nov 8):
Findings:
• Pain: "Spending 30 hours/week on manual reporting"
• Goal: "Need real-time visibility into pipeline"
• Concern: "Budget is tight this year"

Signals missed: Budget concern mentioned early

---

Pricing Discussion (Dec 12):
Findings:
• Objection: "This is more than we budgeted"
• Objection: "Competitor A quoted 40% less"

Our response: "Let's focus on value..."
→ Should have: Offered pilot, provided TCO analysis

---

Final Call (Jan 5):
Findings:
• Decision: "Going with Competitor A"
• Reason: "Price was the deciding factor"
• Feedback: "Your product was better, but couldn't justify 40% premium"

---

WHAT WE DID WELL
----------------
✓ Strong technical demo - "best demo we've seen"
✓ Good rapport with CTO
✓ Security review passed quickly

WHAT WE MISSED
--------------
✗ Didn't address budget concern from Day 1
✗ CFO engaged too late (day 42)
✗ No TCO analysis provided
✗ Didn't set competitive trap early
✗ Lost to price, not product

---

LESSONS FOR NEXT TIME
---------------------

1. When prospect mentions budget is tight:
   → Immediately align on budget range
   → Position value before pricing
   → Identify economic buyer early

2. When competitor is mentioned:
   → Acknowledge directly
   → Set differentiation landmines
   → Provide TCO comparison proactively

3. For deals in this segment:
   → Engage CFO/finance earlier
   → Have ROI model ready by demo
   → Consider pilot offer for price-sensitive

---

LIBRARY IMPLICATIONS
--------------------

Update Competitor A battlecard:
• Add: "40% cheaper" response
• Add: TCO comparison framework
• Add: Trap questions about hidden costs

Update CTO persona:
• Add concern: "Justifying premium pricing"

Update Enterprise playbook:
• Add: CFO engagement requirement by Day 30
• Add: Budget qualification in discovery

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations

Based on analysis, offer actionable next steps:

```
Based on this analysis, I recommend:

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
-----------------
1. Create Competitor A TCO battlecard section
   → /octave:pmm battlecard --competitor "Competitor A" --focus pricing

2. Update discovery checklist with budget qualification
   → /octave:library update pb_xxx --add "Budget qualification by meeting 2"

3. Review current pipeline for similar patterns
   → /octave:research --for pipeline-review

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------
1. Consider pricing/packaging review for competitive segment
2. Create "pilot program" offer for price-sensitive deals
3. Develop CFO-specific value story
