# Strategic Sales Coaching Framework

A generalized enterprise strategic sales coaching framework. Apply these frameworks to any B2B product when preparing for a customer-facing meeting. Each framework is a lens — use the ones that fit the meeting type and deal stage.

## Belief Stacking

Before a prospect will lean in, they must hold a sequence of beliefs. Stack 5-6 beliefs they need to arrive at before your product feels inevitable.

**How to apply:**
1. List 5-6 sequential beliefs the prospect must hold (each builds on the previous)
2. Rate each: **Proven** / **Mostly Proven** / **Needs Proof**
3. Focus meeting energy on the weakest link in the chain
4. Prepare specific evidence (proof points, data, stories) for any belief rated below Proven

**Example belief stack (generic):**
1. "Our current approach has a ceiling" — Needs Proof
2. "The cost of doing nothing is growing" — Mostly Proven
3. "A purpose-built solution exists for this" — Proven
4. "This vendor understands our world" — Needs Proof
5. "The ROI justifies the investment" — Needs Proof
6. "Now is the right time to act" — Mostly Proven

The beliefs rated "Needs Proof" become your meeting priorities. Everything else is supporting context.

## Ecosystem Positioning

Position your product as an essential layer that makes the customer's existing stack better — not a replacement for anything they already use.

**How to apply:**
1. Map the customer's current tool stack (CRM, marketing automation, data tools, etc.)
2. Identify where your product fits in their architecture
3. Frame as the connective tissue or intelligence layer that improves every adjacent tool
4. Avoid "rip and replace" language — use "enhance," "amplify," "unlock"

**Key questions to prepare:**
- "What tools does this account already use that we integrate with or enhance?"
- "Where are the gaps between their tools that we fill?"
- "How do we make their existing investments more valuable?"

## Enhancement Framing

Frame your product as the thing that makes everything else in their stack better. Not a standalone replacement — an amplifier.

**How to apply:**
1. For each major tool in their stack, articulate how your product makes it more effective
2. Position the value as multiplicative, not additive: "You already have X — we make X 3x more effective"
3. Use their own language for the tools they use; use your language for the outcome

**Template:**
> "You've already invested in [their tool]. What [your product] does is make every [action they take in that tool] smarter by [specific enhancement]. Without us, [their tool] works. With us, [their tool] compounds."

## Ideal Customer Fit

Evaluate whether this account is in your sweet spot. Not every deal is worth the same energy. The best meetings happen when you know — and can articulate — why this account is a perfect fit.

**Signals of ideal fit:**
- Multi-axis complexity (multiple products x multiple personas x multiple territories)
- High volume of the activity your product improves
- Existing investment in adjacent tools (ecosystem play)
- Pain that scales with their growth (the problem gets worse as they succeed)
- Executive visibility on the problem you solve

**How to apply:**
1. Before the meeting, score this account against your ideal customer criteria
2. If it's a top-fit account, say so in the meeting — conviction is persuasive
3. If it's a stretch, know which aspects are strong and which need validation

## Guardrail Reframe

In automated or agentic workflows, context equals control. If the customer is adopting automation, AI, or scaling human-driven processes, position your product as the guardrail that prevents things from going off-brand, off-message, or off-strategy.

**How to apply:**
1. Identify what the customer is automating or scaling
2. Name the risk of scaling without guardrails (inconsistency, brand damage, wasted spend)
3. Position your product as the context layer that keeps automation aligned

**Template:**
> "The more you automate [process], the more critical it becomes that every [output] stays [on-brand / on-message / on-strategy]. Without guardrails, automation amplifies mistakes as fast as it amplifies wins."

## Socratic Discovery

Use questions, not statements, to guide the prospect to their own conclusions. Three categories of questions:

### Diagnostic Questions
Expose assumptions and surface the real state of things.

- "Walk me through how [process] works today, step by step."
- "When [process] breaks down, what's the first thing that happens?"
- "How do you know if [activity] is working or not?"
- "If I talked to your team, would they describe the process the same way?"

### Forcing-Function Questions
Drive binary clarity — force a yes/no or this/that answer.

- "If you had to choose between [option A] and [option B] today, which one?"
- "Is this a 'nice to have' or a 'need to have' for [upcoming event/quarter]?"
- "If we could solve just one of these problems, which one moves the needle most?"
- "Would you move forward if [specific condition] were met?"

### Accountability Questions
Test follow-through and reveal whether there's real momentum.

- "What happens if this doesn't get solved by [date]?"
- "Who else needs to be in the room for a decision?"
- "What would need to be true for you to move forward this quarter?"
- "If I send you [deliverable], will you share it with [decision maker] this week?"
