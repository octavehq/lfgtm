# Product Positioning Coaching Framework

A positioning coaching framework based on April Dunford's methodology ("Obviously Awesome" and "Sales Pitch"). Apply these frameworks when preparing talk tracks, scripting meeting narratives, or structuring how you present your product in any customer-facing conversation.

## The Positioned Sales Pitch (5 Steps)

April Dunford's signature sales pitch structure. Script each step for the specific meeting and audience.

### Step 1: Set the Status Quo
Describe the world as the customer knows it today. Acknowledge how they currently solve the problem. This builds credibility — you understand their reality before prescribing a solution.

> "Most teams today handle [problem] by [current approach]. It works up to a point..."

### Step 2: Name the Problem
Articulate what's broken about the status quo. Be specific. The pain should feel familiar and slightly uncomfortable — they should nod, not shrug.

> "But as [trigger — growth, complexity, scale], [current approach] starts to [break down / create risk / cost more]. Teams end up [specific negative outcome]."

### Step 3: Introduce the Category
Frame what kind of solution exists for this problem. The category sets expectations for price, competitors, features, and success metrics. Use the customer's own language when they've already named the category.

> "That's why a new category of [category name] has emerged — purpose-built for [specific use case]."

### Step 4: Position Your Product in the Category
Now introduce your product as the best version of this category for their specific situation. Differentiate on the axes that matter to this buyer.

> "[Your product] is the [differentiator] [category]. Unlike [alternatives], we [unique capability] so that [outcome]."

### Step 5: Proof
Back it up. Metrics, customer stories, third-party validation. The proof must match the claim — if you claimed speed, prove speed. If you claimed ROI, prove ROI.

> "[Customer similar to them] saw [specific metric] within [timeframe]. Here's what their [role similar to prospect] said: '[quote].'"

## Feature → Value → Emotional Payoff

Every feature mention in a meeting must climb this ladder. If you stop at features, you lose.

| Level | What It Sounds Like | Example |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| **Feature** | "We have [capability]" | "We integrate with your CRM" |
| **Value** | "Which means [business outcome]" | "Every rep has full context before they reach out" |
| **Emotional Payoff** | "So you [feel/achieve/avoid]" | "Your team stops embarrassing you with generic outreach" |

**How to apply:**
1. List every feature you plan to mention in the meeting
2. For each, write the value (business outcome) and the emotional payoff
3. In the meeting, always land on value or emotion — never leave it at the feature
4. Match the payoff to the stakeholder's role: executives care about risk and growth; practitioners care about efficiency and autonomy

## Competitive Alternatives

Per Dunford: the competitive alternative is NOT your competitor — it's what the customer would actually DO if your product didn't exist. Get this wrong and every other positioning decision is wrong.

**Common competitive alternatives:**
- Build it in-house (engineering team cobbles together scripts and spreadsheets)
- Stitch together multiple tools (Frankenstein stack)
- Hire more people (throw bodies at the problem)
- Just wing it (do nothing structured)
- Use a general-purpose tool not built for this (e.g., using a spreadsheet for project management)

**How to apply:**
1. Before the meeting, identify what this specific customer is doing today (their actual alternative)
2. Understand the strengths of that alternative (it's cheap, it's familiar, it works "well enough")
3. Articulate the hidden costs — the things they're paying for that don't show up on a P&L (time, inconsistency, risk, missed opportunities)
4. Position your product against the *real* alternative, not a competitor they may not be evaluating

**Template:**
> "Right now, your team handles this by [real alternative]. And honestly, it works — to a point. But what it costs you in [hidden cost 1] and [hidden cost 2] adds up. [Your product] eliminates that by [specific capability]."

## Category Framing

Per Dunford, this is the single most impactful positioning decision you make. The category sets buyer expectations for price, competitors, features, and success metrics.

**Rules:**
1. If the customer has already named the category, use their language — don't fight it
2. If no established category exists, define one that makes your strengths the table stakes
3. The category should instantly trigger the right mental model: "Oh, it's a [category] — I know what those do and why I'd need one"
4. Test it: if you say your category name and the buyer says "what's that?", you're too novel. If they say "oh, like [inferior competitor]", you're too generic.

**How to apply in meetings:**
- Introduce the category early (Step 3 of the sales pitch)
- Reinforce it throughout: "As a [category], we [do thing that categories do, but better]"
- If the buyer miscategorizes you, gently reframe: "I can see why you'd think of us that way. The way our customers describe it is [correct category]."

## Language Mining

Harvest the customer's exact words for pain, priorities, and desired outcomes. Per Dunford: positioning language should come from customers, not founders.

**How to apply:**
1. During discovery or prior calls, write down the exact phrases the customer uses
2. Mirror those phrases back in your meeting talk tracks
3. In the battle plan, note "customer language" vs "our language" — always default to theirs
4. Pay special attention to how they describe their pain — that's your marketing copy

**What to listen for:**
- How they describe the problem (their words for the pain)
- How they describe success (their words for the desired outcome)
- How they refer to their current solution (their words for the competitive alternative)
- Metaphors and analogies they use (these reveal mental models)

## Heads on Pillows Test

Describe your product in 10 words or fewer. If the ideal customer immediately says "I need that" — your positioning works. If they say "that's interesting" — it's not there yet.

**How to apply before a meeting:**
1. Write your 10-word description
2. Test it against the specific stakeholders attending
3. If it doesn't pass the test for this audience, adjust for this meeting
4. The 10-word description should lead every conversation and appear in the first 60 seconds

**Template:**
> "[Your product] is [10 words that make the ideal buyer say 'I need that']."
